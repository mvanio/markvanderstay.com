I\'m a email marketer with a background in statistical programming and a passion for R, data visualization, Shiny and machine learning.

On this blog I record what I learn so I can share it.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/m_vanders) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mark-vanderstay).
